<p>One thing to strive for in data analysis projects is reducing waste - wasted effort, wasted attention, wasted time. Some advice from the side of a recycling bin:</p>
<div id="reduce" class="section level3">
<h3>Reduce</h3>
<p>Consider carefully the question at hand and ask which analyses are necessary. If working with a client or colleague, ask them to order the priority of their questions. Do the most important things first. You may not end up needing all of them.</p>
</div>
<div id="reuse" class="section level3">
<h3>Reuse</h3>
<p>If you have analyses that can be re-run easily with different parameters, such as on subgroups of the main population, try that. Write programs in a modular way so that they can be reordered or repurposed in different contexts.</p>
</div>
<div id="recycle" class="section level3">
<h3>Recycle</h3>
<p>If a whole program cannot be salvaged for a new purpose, perhaps definitions, algorithms, or procedures can be. Break down a program into its basic logical elements and use them to build anew.</p>
</div>
