##### Comparative stroke, bleeding, and mortality risks in older Medicare patients treated with oral anticoagulants for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 

*Published in the American Journal of Medicine*

Excerpt: Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are alternatives to warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Randomized trials compared NOACs to warfarin, but none have compared individual NOACs against each other for safety and effectiveness...We performed a retrospective new-user cohort study of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation enrolled in US Medicare who initiated warfarin (n=183,318), or a standard dose of dabigatran (150 mg twice-daily; n=86,198), rivaroxaban (20 mg once-daily; n=106,389) or apixaban (5 mg twice-daily; n=73,039) between October 2010 and September 2015.
